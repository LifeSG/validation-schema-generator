# validation-schema-generator

-   typescript-based
-   JSON to Yup conversion
-   field types baked into library

The validation schema generator is meant to be used in conjunction with the [web-frontend-engine](https://github.com/LifeSG/web-frontend-engine/) and any backend service interaction with the frontend engine. It is able to convert validation config in JSON format to a validation schema ([Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)) that will be used on both frontend and backend.

## Intention

Since form submission involves validation on both frontend and backend, it makes sense to have a common library for it. This ensures the validation logic is the same across both ends and prevents duplication of codes. This library is meant for stacks that use typescript in both frontend and backend.
